# Olist Test - Documentation

This project is a resolution of the Olist test, one of the steps of the application process to work as a front end developer. It aims to implement a new **account page**, composed of **name**, **email** and **password** inputs with a **strong measure indicator** to a **password confirmation**. All the features below are required.

## Features Requeried

Features | Done ✔️
-------- | ------
The submit button must be disabled until the form is valid | ✔️
The Name is required and Email must be a valid email | ✔️
The invalid input fields should have a border color like the style guide | ✔️
The valid input fields should have a border color like the style guide | ✔️
The Password input must make use of the sequence of validation presented in the Style Guide | ✔️
If the form is valid, the submit button should be clickable | ✔️
When the form is submitted, it should present a loading status | ✔️  ️️️ ️️

`Installing` 

Download the project or clone it to your PC, after in your terminal, enter the **`./olist-test`** directory and run **`npm install`** to install all the project dependencies.

`Testing Project`

To run tests in your terminal enter the **`./olist-test`** directory and run **`npm test`** to run all tests.

## Deploy

This project was deployed in the host service **Netlify**, you can check the result by clicking [here](https://olist-test-raissa-martins.netlify.com).

## Build

Because of the lack of time due to my delay, I did the build manually, but I intend to do it using Grunt which I have no knowledge about, so I will study about it and I intend to apply it in this project soon.

## Considerations

This section is to share my considerations about the experience in developing this test.

* I am in the technology area just a few months and in the learning process. Even so, I really liked to have challenged myself to apply what I learned and try to resolutions that I had never used before, trying to solve problems was the most challenging of the whole process, but I am very pleased to have achieved the expected outcome;
* I started the test with **HTML**, then built **CSS**, finally started **Javascript**. I used **Sass** to build **CSS**, it helped me create a pattern for the elements, it left my code clean and not repetitive. I believe it is a great tool for facilitating the organization of style-related codes;
* As for building the dynamics and interactions with **Javascript**, I thought it would be more complicated, but it flowed very well, I managed to create all the **features** proposed, at times I had no idea what to do, but with a little research, managed to track a resolution for what it was needed to resolve the problem;
* Two things were very challenging for me during the process, the first one, building **automated tests**, I had never seen or done one of them, I had to research and attend some classes, at first I couldn't get answers to my doubts, I used the **Jasmine** framework in standalone mode, I understood its operation, I was able to test it, but I could not apply it to my project, as I was unsuccessful I installed it by npm, but I had difficulties to understanding its dynamics;
* The other challenge was to deploy the project to **netlify**, I had never used a task automator, I researched and saw that **Grunt** could meet my need, so I had to study it to understand how it worked and try to use it. In the project, meanwhile, I was deploying it manually so I could see the project running.
